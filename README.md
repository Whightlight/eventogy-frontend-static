# React Tech Task

## Setup

- Just paste in your UNSPLASH_ACCESS_KEY in a .env file and run 'npm run dev'!

## OVERVIEW

You are tasked to build a simple interface against a slice of a REST API by forking this GitHub repository containing the foundation of a React + Next.js application.

- API Endpoint - https://www.eventogy.com/api/events.json
- For images, feel free to use an open API like unsplash or picsum to get a unique image for each card
- Design Mock Up:

## OBJECTIVES

Demonstrate that you're capable of planning and structuring your code in a way that allows for reusable, scalable, and well-thought-out components that will interact with a RESTful public API.
Demonstrate your attention to detail in the presentation layer - does it work as expected, is it responsive, and are there any finishing touches.

## SPECIFICATIONS

You can (and should) use any and all resources at your disposal to complete the task. We suggest using style libraries like **Tailwind** and prebuilt component libraries, like **Shadcn**, rather than spending time manually styling the page.

Weâ€™re looking to see how much you can achieve in 2, 3 hours, but feel free to spend extra time in order to complete a subtask or fix a bug. Make sure you commit your project to the forked Git repository and periodically commit as you progress in the task.

### Bonus points

Use UI interactive effects for elements such as loading the event cards. Convert the project to Typescript if you're feeling extra brave.
